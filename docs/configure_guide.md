* Make sure your device is Turned on. The Smart Speaker will appear on the screen only if it is in Access Point mode. The Device is by default in access point mode if it has not been set up before. If you want to reconfigure the device, click on the reset button for ~7 seconds until you hear a beep sound, wait for the process to finish and your speaker will pop up on the screen as shown.
